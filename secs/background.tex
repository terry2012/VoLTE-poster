\section{Mitigations}
\label{sec:background}
\textbf{Network side mitigation. }Considering that the dedicated bearer is supposed to only talk directly with the internal IMS nodes, we have worked with one of the operators to apply additional traffic blocking rules on the packet gateway to block the packets that have external IP address as their source or destination addresses from using IMS APN, which prevents \texttt{IF1} from forwarding traffic to attacker controlled servers and protects it from unsolicited traffic. We evaluate this countermeasure in the experimental environment and verify that it blocks the free data-ride without affecting other services. However, this approach only blocks the ICMP tunnel towards\texttt{IF0}, and other protocols may also be abused to conduct data free-ride attack.\cut{In addition, we suggest operators to limit the bandwidth for the dedicated bearer in order to mitigate the potential threat of abuse, since there is no valid reason to allocate bandwidth for VoLTE that far exceeds its requirement.} 

\textbf{Device side mitigation. }The lack of access control of network interfaces on the device is inherited from the Linux kernel, where privileged user is allowed to change the routing table. We suggest migrating sensitive functionalities such as forwarding rules to a trusted space (e.g., TrustZone~\cite{trustzone}), which can prevent it from manipulation from untrusted sources.
