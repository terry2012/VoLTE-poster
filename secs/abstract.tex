Mobile data is charged by operators according to the traffic volume, while the voice call is usually charged by the call duration. We find that an emerging telephony service called Voice over LTE (VoLTE) introduces critical problem to the current billing system deployed in the cellular network, which allows fraudulent users to utilize high-speed LTE data totally for free by transmitting data using the voice channel dedicated for VoLTE! Compared with the ``toll-free'' data access attacks proposed by previous work~\cite{peng2012mobile,go2014gaining} that rely on spoofing or the assumption that operators don't charge specific types of traffic(e.g., DNS, TCP retransmission), the data free-ride attack we discover leverages the inconsistency between operators' charging policies for voice and data. We attribute this problem to the lack of access control of network interfaces on both device and network sides. We verify that the problem affects at least two of the major operators in the U.S. and have worked with one of them to deploy mitigation countermeasures against such attack.
