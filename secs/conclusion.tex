\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we take the first step to quantify the performance of the new telephony technology, VoLTE and study its implication on relevant QoE metrics. We also design and implement a VoLTE problem detection tool running on end users' devices to examine the impact of these problems on user experience. We peform stress testing based on the insights drew from the in-depth call reliability measurement and uncover three categories of problems lying in the VoLTE related protocol design and implementation, which are the potential causes behind 3 major VoLTE problems that affect users nationwide.
