Mobile data is charged according to the traffic volume, while the voice call is usually charged by the call duration. We find that an emerging telephony service, Voice over LTE (VoLTE), introduces critical problem to the current billing system deployed in the cellular network: it allows fraudulent users to utilize high-speed LTE data \emph{for free} by transmitting data using the voice channel dedicated to VoLTE. Compared with the ``toll-free'' data access attacks proposed by previous work~\cite{peng2012mobile,go2014gaining} that rely on spoofing or the assumption that operators don't charge specific types of traffic (e.g., DNS, TCP retransmission), the data free-ride attack leverages the inconsistency between operators' charging policies for voice and data.

We successfully implement this attack using ICMP tunnel between a device and a proxy server, which can fetch content from the Internet for free with up to 7 Mbps bandwidth. We verify that this problem affects at least two of the major operators in the US. We attribute this problem to the lack of access control of network interfaces dedicated to VoLTE on both device and network sides, and are working with one of the operators to deploy mitigation countermeasures against such attack.
